# Oz World 
## A Modern Fairy Tale

A creative web project that reimagines The Wizard of Oz with a new protagonist and message about self-discovery.

## 📖 About The Story

This is not about Dorothy this time, and not even the same Oz. This version tells the tale of a boy named Oz who learns that life isn't like the cartoons—heroes don't win easily, and the real struggle is often hidden. Through ups and downs, with wonderful friends by his side, Oz discovers he was the hero to himself all along.

**Core Theme:** Self-discovery, friendship, and realizing the hero within yourself.
