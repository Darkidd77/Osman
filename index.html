        <p>This is not about Dorothy this time, and not even the same Oz. This time it's a different, shorter version of another tale. There once was a kind, lovely boy named Oz who used to dream big and was confident in himself. He thought life was just like cartoons the hero always wins. Little did he know that heroes didn't win easily. Cartoons sometimes skip the struggle that the hero went through to become a hero.</p>

      <p>
        Later on, Oz got reality handed to him. Life is unpredictable, and people are unpredictable as well. Oz started doubting himself: Is he gone? What he dreamed of is he even capable? Through the ups and downs, Oz met wonderful friends along the way, just like Dorothy did.

      <p>
        Oz finally realized that he was, from the start, the hero to himself. He just needed to discover himself more. Friends and life helped him get to that realization. Oz goes on to know the true hero inside him more and more.
